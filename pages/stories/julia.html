            <p dir="ltr">
                “Julia, Julia
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Morning moon, touch me
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                So I sing a song of love
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Julia”
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Yeah I was named after a Beatles song. Well not really, my great grandma on
                my mom’s mom’s side was named Julia and my dad likes the song so it’s
                somewhere in the middle. It’s kind of a weird song but whatever.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Anyways, I’m going to my aunt’s house in New England today, by myself but my
                dad’s driving me. I don’t really know why they call it New England because
                it seems very old: old houses, old people, old dead trees. The type of place
                you only hear about in a history classroom. But it is actually nice, it’s at
                least a change of pace from the busy gray streets of Baltimore.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Getting out of my dad’s car (or station wagon as he loves to call it), I
                look up at the old house, alone atop a small, graceful hill. It’s a
                Victorian, big, the kind you only see overgrown and forgotten at the end of
                a road before a freeway. But this one’s well kempt, and quite beautiful,
                coated in white and gold and lavender above the grassy terrain, and beneath
                the cold gray sky. It is cold, but not too bad.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Wow, that’s a great old house. Like a manor!” exclaims my dad, turning
                toward the house as he shuts the car door.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Yeah, it’s nice”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “It’s a Victorian, must’ve been built in…hmmm…the 1800s! Wow!”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Yup, in the Victorian era.”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Aww, you’re so sharp and grown up! ” He says as he ruffles the hair atop my
                head, “all ready to go off to college.”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “I’ve still got another year,” I remark as I fix my hair.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “You’ll like it here, you loved it here when you were little, remember?”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “No, not really.”
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                I look over and see a small, empty, flat lake with just a few ducks floating
                on it, their ripples flowing evenly throughout the water. It looks like it’s
                straight out of a blurry painting from the 19th century. It’s nice. It looks
                too cold to swim in, it’s fall (my thanksgiving break), and I’m already cold
                just standing here. I could learn to fish maybe.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Beautiful lake,” he looks over at me, “I remember being here back in 96, 97
                maybe? around the time I met your mother. Well, it was summertime and we had
                a great time swimming around the lake, jumping off that rock on the left
                there, yeah. Not this time of year though, it’s probably freezing!”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “I could probably jump in, like a quick plunge. Might be tough.”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                We pause to watch as a duck flees the lake.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “The lake matches your dress!”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                I look down, then up again, “Mmmm, not really, it’s less blue.”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Well, I guess it’s more of a purple. Like that purple trim on the house.”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Hmmm, well, I guess it’s somewhere in between, purplish bluish.”
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                From behind us, “Hey guys! I haven’t seen you two in forever!”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Hi!” I saw as I turn to greet her warm hug.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Hey Leah! so good to see you too, it’s gorgeous here, just how I remember
                it!”
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                She has short gray hair, wearing her flowing black shawl-dress thing and an
                amethyst silver amulet. My mom (and Leah) always say that she chooses
                comfort over looks, but I think her outfits are pretty.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                My dad: “Need any help with your bags?”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “It’s just one,” plus my backpack, “I’ve got it.”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Leah turns to me, “Oh, it’s so good to see you, you’re so grown up.”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Heh, thanks.” She’s really sweet.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Well, I’ll be off then,” my dad.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Farewell on your journey, it’s good seeing you!”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Bye dad,” I wave as he walks toward the car, looking up at the dead trees
                and out at the lake, the victorian. He looks like the protagonist of an 80s
                teen movie walking away from the camera as the credits fade onto the screen.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                He’s gone on a weekend trip up the Catskills by himself, to meditate, while
                I stay with my aunt and my mom stays home. He’s always going on about
                meditation and yoga or whatever. Every time I expect him to come down the
                mountain like a pious and thoughtful monk, but last time the only revelation
                he made was about how Neil Young’s a musical and spiritual genius and there
                will never be anyone like him ever again.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Anyway, me and Leah have dinner because I’ve had a long drive and it’s
                around dinner time so I must be hungry (I kinda am). It’s pasta with tomato
                sauce, probably because my dad told her I’m a picky eater and pasta is one
                of his prime examples of food I’ll eat. The dining room has high ceilings
                and an elegant, somewhat dusty chandelier with electric bulbs shaped like
                teardrop flames. My aunt says it’s not original, but it’s still old.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                She gives me a house tour: 3 beds, 2 and a half baths (whatever that means),
                and a small, cozy library with a single green bench, a window to the lake,
                and my aunt’s husband Larry, who’s tucked inside a small ornate box which he
                made himself. Leah calls it her “book nook.” Well, there was a door we
                passed on the way to Leah’s room. I remember looking at the doorknob, key in
                the keyhole expecting her to turn it but she kept on walking past, like we
                had already been there. I guess that’s the third bedroom because otherwise
                it’s just Leah’s room and the room for me.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                The room I’m sleeping in was/is my cousin’s.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “She’s not here most of the year, but still she won’t let me convert it into
                a cute little home office. Well, oh well.”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “It does sound nice to always have your room to come home to.”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Yup, my daughter’s all grown up but she still cherishes her tiny slice of
                childhood.”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “She’s in Philly, right?”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Yeah, she’s gonna be at grandma’s for thanksgiving! You’ll get to meet her
                girlfriend, she’s lovely. Oh, I’m so excited!”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Yay! It’s been so long.”
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                I look out past the bed, past the Cure poster, past the permanently messy
                desk, out the window, and onto the lake beneath the darkening sky, just
                beginning to blossom with stars. But on the lake rests a figure wearing a
                black cloak-like thing atop a small boat. Unmoving, save for a slight shift
                of the arm, letting me know that he’s alive. Fishing maybe? It’s dim so I
                can’t really see.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Who’s that?” I ask.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Oh that’s my brother, he’s out there all day,” Leah remarks, staring out
                the window.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Huh,” I don’t remember another uncle, “Ooh, so does he stay in that other
                bedroom?”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “No,” she responds.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                In my peripheral vision, I can see fish jumping and ducks leading their
                ducklings across the water, but I’m transfixed by the man on the boat, with
                a silhouette like a cardboard cutout painted with the night’s sky.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Well,” Leah yawns, “I’m getting sleepy, I think it’s time for me to take a
                shower and curl up behind a book. You’re all set?”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Yeah I’m getting tired too.”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Alright. Good night, Julia. It’s so nice to have you here.”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Good night Leah, it’s great to be here.”
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “‘Night,” Leah says, her head peeking in past the edge of the cracked door.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                “Goodnight,” I say as she gently closes the door.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p dir="ltr">
                I yawn, then sit down next to my backpack, retrieving my phone to check in
                on the real world. My friends are texting, planning to go out tonight,
                sounds like they’ll have fun. Ruby wants to know if I’m down.
