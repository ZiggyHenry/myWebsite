                This place is like a ghost town, and I feel like one of those ghosts. People usually don’t pass by, but when they do it’s like watching an animal cross your path, and it’s like being an animal crossing someone’s path. Stopping into the dining hall is like finding a secret hideout full of survivors, but I don’t know where they went now. It doesn’t help that it’s 1:02am, I guess. Goodbye. Next time I see you, <em>here</em> will be a bustling city, full of bright colors and gray.
